# Project Overview: Cohort Analysis for Customer Retention

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to conduct a cohort analysis to understand customer retention over time. By analyzing transaction data, the project aims to:

- **Identify Retention Trends**: Examine how customer retention rates change over time for different cohorts based on their first purchase.

- **Enhance Marketing Strategies**: Utilize insights from cohort performance to inform targeted marketing strategies aimed at improving customer loyalty.

- **Evaluate Customer Engagement**: Assess how effectively different cohorts engage with the platform over time, informing retention strategies.

By achieving these objectives, the project seeks to provide actionable insights that can help businesses optimize their customer retention efforts.

## Key Components

### Data Collection

- **Transaction Data**: Collect essential information, including transaction histories, customer demographics, and product details.

### Data Preprocessing

- **Cleaning**: Address issues such as missing values and inconsistencies within the dataset.
- **Feature Engineering**: Develop meaningful features like cohort dates and cohort indices that are critical for cohort analysis.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- **Visualization**: Use graphs to uncover trends and patterns in customer retention.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Identify correlations between cohorts and retention rates.

### Cohort Model Creation

- **Cohort Assignment**: Assign customers to cohorts based on their first purchase date.
- **Cohort Index Calculation**: Determine the duration (in months) since each cohort's first purchase.

### Cohort Table Creation

- **Cohort Information**: Build a pivot table to track how many customers from each cohort made purchases in subsequent months.

### Model Evaluation

- **Retention Rate Analysis**: Calculate and visualize retention rates for each cohort to understand customer behavior over time.
- **Average Quantity Analysis**: Assess the average quantity of products purchased by each cohort.

### Implementation

- **Targeted Marketing Campaigns**: Use insights from cohort analysis to develop personalized marketing strategies for different customer cohorts.
- **Monitoring and Optimization**: Continuously monitor cohort performance and adjust strategies as needed.

## Expected Outcomes

- **Improved Retention Rates**: By understanding cohort behavior, businesses can tailor their marketing efforts to enhance loyalty and reduce churn.
- **Data-Driven Marketing Strategies**: Actionable insights will inform more effective marketing strategies and resource allocation.
- **Enhanced Customer Understanding**: The project will deepen insights into customer purchasing behaviors and engagement.

## Dataset Overview

### Columns
- **InvoiceNo**: Unique identifier for each transaction.
- **InvoiceDate**: Date and time of the transaction.
- **CustomerID**: Unique identifier for each customer.
- **StockCode**: Unique identifier for each product.
- **Description**: Description of the product.
- **Quantity**: Quantity of products purchased.
- **UnitPrice**: Price per unit of the product.
- **Country**: Country of the customer.

## Conclusion

The cohort analysis provides critical insights into customer retention trends. Below is a structured overview of the cohort performance evaluated:

### Cohort Metrics

- **Retention Rate**: Indicates the percentage of customers from each cohort who continued to make purchases over time.
- **Average Quantity**: Reflects the average number of products purchased by customers in each cohort.

### Observations

- **Healthy Retention Rates**: A retention rate between 20% to 40% is generally considered healthy for e-commerce platforms.
- **Strong Performance of December 2010 Cohort**: This cohort exhibits retention rates above 30%, suggesting effective customer engagement.
- **Decline in December 2011**: Notable decreases in retention rates across cohorts in December 2011 indicate potential challenges affecting customer loyalty.

### Recommendations

- **Investigate Successful Cohorts**: Explore factors that drove high retention in the December 2010 cohort to replicate success in other cohorts.
- **Address Declines in Retention**: Analyze customer feedback and operational changes that may have contributed to the drop in retention rates in December 2011.
- **Implement Targeted Marketing**: Use cohort insights to create personalized marketing campaigns aimed at different customer segments.
- **Continuously Monitor Cohorts**: Regularly analyze cohort data and customer behavior to make informed decisions for improving retention strategies.

By leveraging these insights, businesses can better understand their customers and implement strategies that enhance loyalty and increase sales.
